# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Onboarding & Personalization

## 1. Product Vision & Goals

Build a profile-driven, personalized health platform that maximizes user engagement, retention, and monetization by leveraging deep onboarding, tailored recommendations, and expert-driven content.

## 2. Key Features & Requirements

### A. Profile as Gateway
- Users must complete a profile before accessing the main feed.
- Profile includes: health goals, supplement history, preferred learning style (video, article, podcast), and can be updated from the dashboard.

### B. Personalized Recommendations
- Use profile data to drive recommendations for content, apps, and experts.
- Map interests to app recommendations (e.g., sleep → Whattsupp + Remy).

### C. Custom Expert Email Feeds
- Weekly digests and real-time notifications for followed experts.
- Premium features tied to expert following.

### D. Engagement & Gamification
- Badges/progress bars for profile completion, following experts, trying features.
- Streaks for daily logins or supplement tracking.

### E. Social Proof
- Show stats like “X users with similar interests follow Dr. Huberman.”
- Highlight popular stacks and trending content.

### F. Data Privacy & Controls
- Transparent data usage policies.
- Granular controls for email preferences and data sharing.

### G. Onboarding UX
- Wizard-style onboarding with progress indicators.
- Preview of personalized feed as users select interests/experts.

### H. Analytics
- Track which profile fields/features drive engagement and conversions.
- Use analytics to iterate on onboarding and recommendations.

## 3. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

- **As a new user**, I must complete my profile before accessing the feed, so that my experience is personalized.
- **As a user**, I want to update my profile from the dashboard, so my recommendations stay relevant.
- **As a user**, I want to see badges and progress bars, so I feel motivated to complete my profile and try features.
- **As a user**, I want to follow experts and receive custom email digests, so I stay engaged with relevant content.
- **As a user**, I want to control my data and email preferences, so I feel safe and respected.
- **As a user**, I want to see what’s popular among similar users, so I can discover new content and features.

## 4. Technical Requirements

- Profile schema: health goals, supplement history, learning style, editable from dashboard.
- Recommendation engine MVP: rule-based mapping of profile to content/apps/experts.
- Email infrastructure: transactional and digest emails, real-time notifications.
- Gamification: badges, progress bars, streak tracking.
- Analytics: event tracking for onboarding, profile updates, feature usage.
- Privacy: user controls for data and email preferences.
- Onboarding UI: wizard flow, progress indicators, preview feed.

## 5. Next Steps

1. Design onboarding UI/UX (wireframes, Figma, etc.)
2. Define and implement profile schema (fields, types, validation)
3. Set up email infrastructure (transactional + digest)
4. Build recommendation engine MVP
5. Implement gamification and social proof features
6. Add analytics tracking
7. Test with a small user group and iterate

## 6. Open Questions & Risks

- What profile fields drive the most engagement? (To be validated via analytics)
- How to balance onboarding depth with user drop-off risk?
- What privacy controls are most important to users?
- What are the technical constraints for real-time recommendations and notifications?
